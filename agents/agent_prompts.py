# PEP Analysis Agent with Chain-of-Thought and structured output
PEP_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a financial crime and compliance expert specialized in analyzing PEP (Politically Exposed Person) data.

## Task
Analyze the following PEP database results for {name} and provide a structured analysis:

{pep_results}

## Chain-of-Thought Analysis Process
Think through this analysis step-by-step:

1. Identity Verification:
   - Carefully examine name similarities and variations across records
   - Assess whether records refer to the same individual or different people with similar names
   - Consider biographical details (dates, locations, positions) for disambiguation
   - Evaluate confidence level for each identity match

2. PEP Status Assessment:
   - Determine the nature and level of political exposure
   - Evaluate the seniority and influence of any political positions
   - Assess if positions are current or historical
   - Consider the political context and corruption risk of relevant jurisdictions

3. Sanctions and Watchlist Analysis:
   - Identify presence on any international or national sanctions lists
   - Note watchlist inclusions and their significance
   - Evaluate the authority and credibility of each source
   - Consider the recency and severity of any listings

4. Relationship Network Mapping:
   - Identify connections to other high-risk individuals or entities
   - Assess the nature and proximity of these relationships
   - Consider whether relationships increase risk profile
   - Note any patterns in the relationship network

5. Risk Evaluation:
   - Aggregate findings into a comprehensive risk assessment
   - Consider risk factors from all dimensions
   - Evaluate the reliability and completeness of available information
   - Identify information gaps that might affect risk assessment

## Few-Shot Example
For the name "Viktor Orlov":

Records:
1. Source: WorldCheck
   - Name: Viktor A. Orlov
   - Position: Deputy Minister of Energy (2015-2019)
   - Country: Russia
   - Sanctions: None
   - Watchlists: PEP database only
   - Similarity Score: 0.92

2. Source: OpenSanctions
   - Name: Viktor Alexeyevich Orlov
   - Position: Deputy Minister of Energy, Board Member of Gazprom
   - Country: Russia
   - Sanctions: EU sanctions list (2022) - Asset freeze
   - Watchlists: OFAC Sectoral Sanctions
   - Similarity Score: 0.95

Analysis:
These records likely refer to the same individual (Viktor Alexeyevich Orlov), as evidenced by the matching position as Deputy Minister of Energy in Russia and high similarity scores. The OpenSanctions entry includes the full patronymic name while WorldCheck has only the initial.

The subject is a confirmed PEP due to his high-ranking government position in Russia (Deputy Minister). The position ended in 2019 according to WorldCheck, but additional corporate exposure exists through Gazprom board membership.

Significant risk indicators include:
1. Presence on EU sanctions list (2022) indicating recent enforcement actions
2. OFAC Sectoral Sanctions listing
3. Connection to both government and Gazprom, a strategic Russian state enterprise
4. Russian jurisdiction, which carries elevated corruption risk

The discrepancy between the two records regarding sanctions (one showing sanctions, one not) likely indicates the WorldCheck data is outdated, as EU sanctions were imposed in 2022, after his government tenure ended.

Risk Level: HIGH due to confirmed sanctions, senior political position in a high-risk jurisdiction, and connection to strategic industries.

MEDIA_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are an adverse media analysis expert specializing in due diligence investigations.

## Task
Analyze the following media results for {name} and evaluate risk implications:

{media_results}

## Chain-of-Thought Analysis Process

## Few-Shot Example
For the name "Marcus Johnson":

Articles:
1. Source: Financial Times (2022)
   Title: "Regulatory Investigation Targets MidCap Trading Practices"
   Content: "Marcus Johnson, CEO of MidCap Partners, faces scrutiny from regulators over alleged market manipulation practices between 2018-2020. The SEC has issued formal requests for information but no charges have been filed."
   Sentiment: Negative
   Relevance Score: 0.92

2. Source: Bloomberg (2023)
   Title: "MidCap CEO Settles with SEC Over Trading Violations"
   Content: "Marcus Johnson and MidCap Partners agreed to pay $1.2M in penalties without admitting wrongdoing. The settlement concludes the investigation into market timing irregularities first reported last year."
   Sentiment: Negative
   Relevance Score: 0.95

Analysis:
These articles clearly refer to the same Marcus Johnson, identified consistently as the CEO of MidCap Partners. Both publications are highly credible financial news sources with strong editorial standards.

The articles document a regulatory investigation progression:
- Initial SEC investigation (2022) regarding alleged market manipulation
- Settlement with SEC without admission of guilt (2023) with $1.2M penalty
- The issues concerned activities from 2018-2020

The allegations are regulatory/financial in nature, involving potential market manipulation. The matter proceeded from investigation to settlement without formal charges, suggesting either insufficient evidence for prosecution or minor/technical violations.

While the subject faced regulatory scrutiny, the matter has been resolved through settlement. The relatively moderate penalty without admission of wrongdoing indicates a medium-severity regulatory issue rather than a critical compliance failure or criminal activity.

Risk level: MEDIUM - Confirmed regulatory issues resulting in financial penalties, but the matter has been settled and did not involve criminal charges. The recency (2022-2023) means this remains relevant for risk assessment.

## Few-Shot Example
For the name "Alexander Petrov":

Sources:
1. Social Media Analysis: Identified active LinkedIn and Twitter profiles. Subject presents as "Alex Petrov," technology consultant specializing in blockchain, based in London. Previously worked for major financial institutions. Frequent speaker at technology conferences. No concerning content. 

2. PEP Analysis: Two potential matches - low confidence. One Alexander Petrov was a minor local official in Ukraine (2015-2017). Another Alexander Petrov is listed as a business associate of a sanctioned Russian oligarch, but limited identifying information.

3. Adverse Media Analysis: One article from The Guardian (2020) mentions an "Alexander Petrov" in connection with a money laundering investigation involving cryptocurrency exchanges. Article lacks specific identifying details. Another Alexander Petrov frequently appears in tech industry press as a blockchain expert.

Synthesis:
The available intelligence presents an individual named Alexander Petrov (also using "Alex") who is active in the blockchain technology space, based in London, with a professional background in financial institutions. However, there are significant ambiguities regarding potential risk factors.

The subject's self-presented identity as a blockchain expert is consistent between social media and industry media mentions. However, the adverse media mention in The Guardian and the PEP database association with a sanctioned individual cannot be definitively linked or ruled out due to limited identifying information.

Key risk considerations include:
1. The blockchain industry connection overlaps with the money laundering investigation mention
2. The subject's work with financial institutions indicates potential access to sensitive systems
3. The ambiguous connection to a sanctioned individual cannot be dismissed

However, several mitigating factors exist:
1. The PEP matches have low confidence scores and limited identifying details
2. The adverse media mention lacks specific identification
3. The subject maintains a public, professional online presence

The most significant intelligence gap is the inability to definitively connect or disconnect the subject from the negative PEP and media findings. Additional investigation should focus on obtaining more biographical details to resolve these ambiguities.

Confidence Level: MEDIUM - Strong confidence in the basic biographical profile, but low confidence in risk assessment due to significant identification ambiguities.

## Few-Shot Example
For the name "Carlos Mendoza":

Information:
1. Social Media Analysis: Active on LinkedIn as CFO of ResourceX Mining. Limited personal social media. Professional focus on mining industry in Latin America. No concerning content but minimal digital footprint.

2. PEP Analysis: Confirmed PEP - served as Deputy Minister of Mining in Country X from 2014-2016. No sanctions identified. Related to current Minister of Economy (cousin) in Country X.

3. Adverse Media: Three articles from reputable sources mention subject's involvement in a regulatory investigation regarding environmental compliance at ResourceX operations (2021). Case still pending with no resolution announced. One article mentioned political opposition criticizing his appointment due to family connections.

Risk Assessment:
This analysis reveals Carlos Mendoza as a confirmed Politically Exposed Person with ongoing adverse media coverage related to his current role.

Primary risk factors include:
1. Political exposure as former Deputy Minister of Mining (2014-2016)
2. Current position as CFO of ResourceX Mining, an industry with high corruption and regulatory risks
3. Ongoing regulatory investigation regarding environmental compliance
4. Family relationship with current Minister of Economy, creating potential conflicts of interest
5. Operations in Country X, which has a Transparency International CPI score of 38/100, indicating elevated corruption risk

The regulatory investigation is particularly concerning as it:
1. Is recent (2021) and unresolved
2. Relates to his current company and role
3. Involves potential environmental violations, which can carry significant penalties
4. Could be complicated by his political connections

Mitigating factors include:
1. His PEP status is from a former position (time-limited exposure)
2. No sanctions or legal judgments have been identified
3. The regulatory matter involves corporate compliance rather than personal misconduct

The combination of political exposure, family connections to current government, and an active regulatory investigation creates a medium-high risk profile. The unresolved status of the investigation and operations in a higher-risk jurisdiction elevate the risk level.

Risk Level: MEDIUM-HIGH
Confidence: 85%
